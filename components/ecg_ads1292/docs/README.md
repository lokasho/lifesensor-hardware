# lifesensor ecg_ads1292
This document describes the [ECG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) component based on Texas Instruments integrated ECG front end [ADS1292](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1292.pdf).

**WARNING: THIS CIRCUIT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTRICAL SHOCKS! ALWAYS USE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL APPROVED POWER SUPPLIES! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

---

## Objectives
This component is developed to quickly provide a first ECG sensor that can deliver reference data for comparison with other self-developed and possibly cheaper ECG frontends. It will also provide the possibility to test other (software) components like the pulse detection and the lifesensors sensor bus with real data.

## Features
To be continued.
